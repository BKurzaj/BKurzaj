- 👋 Hi, I’m @BKurzaj
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things and meeting interesting people
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Github :-)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different ideas for embedded SW or tooling in the area of automation industries,
-     i.e. fielbus protocolls, IO-Link, MQTT, OPC UA, Werbserver, REST ifc., and evrything that makes fun
- 📫 How to reach me: via this Github account
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: As belonging to the boomer generation I work on embedded SW for about 35 years,
  we now have unlimited internet access, mobiles, powerfull computers and tool, but we still produce the same kind of bugs 
  as at the beginning of my career - maybe AI is now our last hope ;-)
